                positions closed on a given day, shall not exceed 5% of the initial balance at any

            </li>
            <li>It is highly recommended that traders do not exploit system bugs. Any evidence

                the announcement of the relevant macroeconomic publication until two minutes
                after the announcement of the relevant macroeconomic publication. If an unusual
                event occurs (e.g. elections), the Provider is encouraged to closely monitor the
                Client's dashboard calendar for high-impact news. If the Provider is using SL/ TP
                in trading and any of these hits during the restricted period of time of high impact
                news, it will be considered as rule violation
            </li>
